# Dx12Learning
Dx12 project to learn how to use DirectX 12

Some libraries/tools that I plan to link and use for this project:

* SDL2: Native window management
* PIXRuntimeEvents: Library to place markers in Command Lists sent to GPU
* PIX: Tool to profile GPU work
* Tracy: C++ Profiler and library to place markers in CPU code
* ImGUI: Debug UI library
* (optional) Sciter: HTML UI library?

Some features I would like to implement:

* Triangle rendering tutorial to start
* Multiple frames in flight
* Basic model rendering
* Basic shadow mapping
* Try implementing basic ray tracing on compute shader
* N-bodies implementation (movement on compute)
* Voxel based terrain rendering
